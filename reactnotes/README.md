# React Notes

![Current UI](Current_UI.png)

This project was originally made with the [React with Firebase Notes / To-Do App Tutorial](https://youtu.be/-RtJroTMDf4) video by Wes Doyle.

The point of this application was to Create a note taking app which used Firebase as a backend to store all the notes. This project is still a work in progress.

# React Firebase Auth

![Current UI](Current_UI.png)

This project was originally made with the [React Firebase User Login & Signup](https://youtu.be/r4EsP6rovwk) video by Dave Bennett.

The point of this application was to Create a note taking app which used Firebase as a backend to store all the notes. This project is still a work in progress.

# Project Manager

![Current UI](Current_UI.png)

This project was originally made with the [ReactJS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A71aqufiNtQ) by Traversy Media. After I finished the course I wanted to style it better because in the course Brad didn't go over styling at all.

The point of this application was to learn and implement different fundamentals in ReactJS.
